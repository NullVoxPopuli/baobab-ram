# baobab-ram

This is the monorepo that produces the `ram-usage-analyzer`.

_A lightweight alternative to the linux package, [smem][ubuntu-smem]_.

[ubuntu-smem]: https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man8/smem.8.html

A sunburst-style chart representing ram usage, inspired by Gnome's Disk Usage Analyzer (also shipped by default with Ubuntu).

This tool is inspired by this [AskUbuntu Question][ask-ubuntu-inspiration].
